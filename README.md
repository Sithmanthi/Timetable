     In Italy, u-pick flowers have now become a trend. Every spring, tulip fields multiply, especially in the area around Milan and Turin, offering visitors not only the chance to buy flowers but also the experience of picking them themselves in the open air.It all started in 2017 when a Dutch couple, Edwin Koeman, 45, and his wife Nitsuhe Wolanios, decided to rent a few hectares of land and planted half a million tulip bulbs on it."We started seven years ago and we've had great success because we were the first to start the u-pick in Italy. We became known all over the country: there were a lot of TV stations and newspapers that came to report because people could cut and pick flowers by themselves,‚Äù said Edwin Koeman, who comes from a family of tulip growers.
